# A hodgepodge of tools
I found some tools to improve out development process and traceability.
(Using markdown language to write a form. It is hell.)

hackpad     https://hackpad.com/
sandstorm   https://sandstorm.io/
hatta       http://hatta-wiki.org/
gitit       http://gitit.net/
gist        https://gist.github.com/
snippets    https://bitbucket.org/snippets

All of these tools have DEMO, you can play.

# Result
- For the moment, the gitit is the best choice.
- I found another python + Mercurial wiki: SahrisWiki
- I will make a todo list example by using gitit in out bitbucket next week.
- If I have spare time, I'll install a sandstorm.
  (This thing is amazing!)

# VPN
Some tools should play by using a VPN connect
can use these tools in linux:
1) pptp-linux
2) network-manager-pptp + network-manager-pptp-gnome
3) pptpconfig
