# Some suggestions for improving the performance of the code

With the development of software projects become more and more complex and huge,
processing more information. We need some simple ideas to improve the performance
of the software.

Here is 3 points:
1) The use of more high performance code
2) Using the data structure more optimized
3) Using the algorithm and the strategy(cache etc.)

### First: performance code

Clear where the code, function or recycling using the most CPU time, IO.
Clear that the use of the language is good at dealing with whick kind of
data type.
Knows imported storages or libraries performance.

### Second: data structure

That is what I am good for. Finish next time.
This article is a bit long.


### Third: algorithm

This part is often accompanied by a large number of modifying code.
Use cache, another In/Out way or multiprocess/multithread to do the 
communication work.


- Steps:
- 1) Should be focus on the code which runing slow.
- 2) Investigation of the most used function.
- 3) Reduce loop for list search/compare.
- 4) Make good use of time to space / space to time. (Use RAM)
- 5) Lastly, use cache or history.
